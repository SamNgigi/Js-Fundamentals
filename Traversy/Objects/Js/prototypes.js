/* 
  So a lot of the tutorials i have encountered talk plenty about the relationship between objects and their prototypes.
  
  Now it seems prototype allow for inheritance in a big way. So for starters everything is an object in JavaScript.

  Object () , Functions(), Numbers(), Strings(), Array(), Mine().

  Now all the objects have properties and methods attached with them. For example,
    Say i had a car object. I can do this in a variety of ways.

    1. OBJECT LITERAL WAY
        let myCar = {
            name: Mercedes,
            color: black
        }

    2.FACTORY FUNCTION WAY
        function Car(name, color) {
          return {
            name,
            color,
          }
        }

        let myNewCar = Car('Mclaren', 'Black')

    3. CONSTRUCTOR WAY
        I) function Car (name, color) {
            this.name = name;
            this.color = color;
        }
          let myCar = new Car('Mercedes','black');

        II) class Car{
          constructor (name, color) {
            this.name = name;
            this.color = color;
          }
        }
          let myOtherCar = new Car('G-Wagon', 'black');
        

  First of all it should be noted that 
   a) A property is a regular variable defined within an object
   b) A method is a regular function defined within an object.
   c) A constructor is a regular function that is used to create object instances.

  So something that is see is emerging is that JavaScript mainly deals with objects and not with classes.

  With Es6 the constructor is meant to accommodate people familiar with classes but it seems in and of itself it is not. 

  In Js objects are created by other objects. And in this case a special kind of function a constructor whereby we use the key word 'new' to indicate that this is a special function. A constructor.

  And because of this JavaScript does not use a class based inheritance system. It uses a prototype-base inheritance system
  
  So what are prototypes?

  So in my very vague definition prototype is where all an
  objects methods are stored.

  To put it another way an objects delegates everything to do with functionality to the prototype.

  To add it is where inheritable functionality is located.

  For example:
*/

function Plant() {
  this.country = 'Mexico';
  this.isOrganic = true;
}

// We add a show name and color method to plant prototype property.

Plant.prototype.show_name_and_color = function () {
  /* 
    We do not need to add name and color params to a prototype since the are defined in the constructor.
  */
  console.log(`I am a ${this.name} and my color is ${this.color}`);
}

// We add the i am organic method to the Plant prototype property.

Plant.prototype.organic_baby = function () {
  console.log("I am organic baby!");
}

function Fruit(fruit_name, fruit_color) {
  this.name = fruit_name;
  this.color = fruit_color;
}

/*  
  Setting all the Fruit's prototype to the Plant constructor, allowing the Fruit to inherit all the Plant prototype methods and properties.
*/
Fruit.prototype = new Plant();
console.log(Fruit.prototype)

/* 
  Creating an object instance from the Fruit constructor.
  In doing so we inherit all the properties and methods from Fruit. Remember also that Fruit inherited from Plant. 
  
  Therefore all methods and properties from Plant are also accessible to
  a_banana.
*/
const a_banana = new Fruit('Banana', 'Yellow');
console.log(a_banana.name) // Banana
console.log(a_banana) // Banana
// Below code executes line 150.
// It returns 'i am a Banana and my color is Yellow'
console.log(a_banana.show_name_and_color())

/*

  NOTE:
    We cannot mix up the way constructors are build.If we do we get wierd syntax errors.

  What is the prototype used for?
  I. Prototypes (prototype property) is the principal manner in which inheritance is implemented in JS as shown in example above.

  II. Prototype (prototype attribute) is also used for accessing an objects properties and methods.
  This is where by using the prototype attribute where can return properties and objects from the parent they were defined in.

  For example;
*/

const myFriends = {
  name: "Ruach Ha-Kodesh",
  age: 1
}
/* 
  To find the name property above, the search will begin directly on the
  myFriends object and it will be found immediately because there is
  where it is found.

  This could be thought of as a prototype chain with one link.

  Lets say we want to call the toString() on the age. The search begins
  on the object itself. Since we did not define it here we move up to the
  parent prototype from with the myFriends object inherited from.

  Now this is where we find out that all object originate, inherit, are
  parented by the Object constructor. And that is where all other objects
  inherit their properties and methods from. Therefore here is where we
  would find the toString method. 

  That would be a prototype chain with two links.

  So winding up according the the ES8 Docs a
  - constructor
    A function object that creates and initializes objects (through the new key word.)
  - prototype
    Is an objects that provides shared properties for other objects.


    So think of prototype as a shared kitchen when living in a hostel.

console.log(myFriends);
