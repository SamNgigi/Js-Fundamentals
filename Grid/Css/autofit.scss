    We put 1fr so that a div can span a column responsively.

    We will use 100px and use auto fit and minmax attribute.

    Had to make it 4 rows for it to be able to adjust responsively row-wise

    To make it dynamically responsive row wise we can use grid-auto-rows.

    This;
    grid-template: repeat(4, 100px) / repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
