      Css grid comes with a new fraction unit that makes all the cols
      responsive.

      --> grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;

      This can be written simply as;

      --> grid-template-column: repeat(3, 1fr);

      We can also do the same for rows and say

      --> grid-template-row: repeat(2, 50px);

      In fact we can do a compressed version and all the above and say

      --> grid-template: repeat(2, 50) / repeat(3, 50);

      Start with the row first. How we write letter L should help us remember the format.
