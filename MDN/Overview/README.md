# APIs

These are ready-made sets of code building block that allow a developer
to easily implement otherwise hard or near impossible programs.

They are similar to build it yourself kits of furniture where by you
only need to assemble the different parts to make say a table or
bookshelf for you home. The alternative would be building from scratch.
Finding the right wood, cutting and sizing it, building the right screws
etc.

They generally fall into two categories.
-Browser APIs.
-3rd party APIs.

## Browser APIs

These are built into the **web **browser and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.
For Example:

- **DOM API.**
   Allows us to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to our page.
- **Geo-location API.**
   Retrieves geographical information. Google Maps uses this to find your location and plot it on their maps.
- **Canvas & WebGL API.**
   Allows us to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Audio & Video APIs.**
   Like `HTMLMedialElement` and `WebRTC` allow us to do really interesting thing with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from the web camera and display it on someone else's computer.

**Third party APIs** are not built into the browser by default, and we generally have to grab their code and info from their websites. Examples

- **_Twitter API_**
- **_Google Maps API_**
